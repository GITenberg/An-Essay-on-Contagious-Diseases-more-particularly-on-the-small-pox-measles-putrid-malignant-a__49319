<h2>CHAP. I.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>Contagious Diseases</i> are generally
defin&#39;d by Physicians to be
such, as are capable of being
communicated to us by the Air, or the
Effluvia of Morbid Bodies. When the
Cause producing these Diseases is general,
and not occasioned by the peculiar
Qualities of particular Places, but
brought from Abroad, they are stiled
<i>Epidemic</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
The Causes therefore of these Diseases
must either be generated in the
Air, or produced from the Effluvia of
Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral Substances
floating in it. And consequently the
Effects of the Contagious Particles must
be extreamly various, according to the
Qualities of the Bodies from which they
are produced.</p>

<p class="indent">When any of these Causes is of so
deleterious a Nature, as not only to be
Infectious, but to destroy all or most of
those that are affected by it, That Disease
is called a Pestilence.</p>

<p class="indent">But before I proceed to examine the
particular Properties and Effects of the
Contagious Particles, it will be Necessary
to Demonstrate the following
Propositions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prop. I.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">The Magnitude of the Particles of the
Blood being increased, Obstructions will
be formed in the Ramifications of the
smaller Vessels, which will happen sooner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
or later, in Proportion to the increased
Magnitude of the Particles, and the
smallness of the Vessels.</p>

<h3><i>Demonstration.</i></h3>

<div class="image-center">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">Let the Canal A be an Artery of a
middle Size, sending out the Branches
C, D, E, F, G, H; Let the Dotts represent
the increased <i>Moleculæ</i> of the Blood,
it is evident that these must be stopt
some where or other in the Ramifications
of the Vessels C, D, E, F, G, H, whenever
the Diameters of the <i>Moleculæ</i> exceed
those of the containing Vessels.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prop. II.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">The Magnitude of the Particles of the
Blood being increased, those Capillary
Vessels nearest the Heart will be soonest
obstructed, and <i>vice versa</i>; The rest in
Proportion to the Velocity of the Blood,
Diameters of the Canals, and their Distance
from the Heart.</p>

<h3><i>Demonstration.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">This is sufficiently evident from the foregoing;
For the sooner those <i>Moleculæ</i>
arrive at the Capillary Vessels, the sooner
those Vessels will be obstructed, and <i>vice
versa</i>, and consequently <i>cæteris paribus</i>
the Capillaries of the Branches C, H, in
the preceeding Figure, which are nearest
the Heart, will be sooner obstructed than
those of E, F.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prop. III.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">The Magnitude of the Particles of the
Blood must be increased either by the
Union of a greater Number of them than
in a Natural State; Or by the Alteration
of their Figure, by which their Surfaces
become larger than before.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span></p>

<h3><i>Demonstration.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">This is evident from the Observations
of <i>Lewenhoeck</i> and <i>Malpighius</i> on the
perspirable and other ultimate Vessels,
which are visible by the Microscope, and
consequently larger than the Orifices of
the Lacteals, which the best Glasses will
not discover. Whence it will follow,
that no Particle can pass this way into
the Blood, which single can obstruct the
Vessels, and consequently this Effect can
only be produced by the Action of the
Particles upon each other, <i>viz.</i> either by
the Union of a greater Number, or some
Alteration in their Figures, whereby
their Surfaces become larger than before.
Thus the Globules of the Blood as appears
by the Microscope, are nearly of a Spherical
Figure, which being the most capacious,
as well as most apt to constitute a Fluid
Body, by touching in the fewest Points
The farther any Particles deviate from
this Figure, the more likely they will be
to obstruct the Vessels, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prop. IV.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">The Contagious Particles being admitted
into the Blood, do there coagulate
its Parts, and form <i>Moleculæ</i> of a
larger Size than ordinary.</p>

<h3><i>Demonstration</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The Force of the Heart and Cavities
of the Canals being the same, when the
Infection is first taken, as before, the
Blood would pass with the same Facility
thro&#39; the Vessels as at other Times,
and Obstructions could not be formed,
were not the <i>Moleculæ</i> thus increased; as
our Senses show they are by the Eruption
of Pustules in the Small-Pox, by
the great Inflammations, Mortifications,
Buboes, and Carbuncles in Malignant
and Pestilential Fevers; and consequently
the Contagious Particles do increase the
Bulk of several of the constituent Parts
of the Blood, by altering the Figures of
its Particles, and forming <i>Moleculæ</i> of a
larger Size than in a Natural State.</p>

<h2>CHAP. II.</h2>

<p class="indent">It has been the constant Observation
of Physicians, as well ancient as modern,
and confirm&#39;d by numerous Instances,
that a hot and moist Constitution
of the Air, joyn&#39;d with southerly Winds,
was generally a Fore-runner of malignant
and Pestilential Fevers. Thus <i>Hippocrates</i>
observes, that the Constitution of
the Air preceeding that malignant Fever
describ&#39;d in the 3d Book of his Epidemics,
&#39;was calm, moist, and southerly, and succeeded
a hot, and dry Season; the Winter,
calm, cloudy, rainy, warm, southerly;
some Showers, and Northerly Winds
about the Equinox; the Spring, calm
and southerly, with great Rains; the
Summer very hot, with little Wind, and
much Rain about the Dog-days<a name="FNanchor_a_a" id="FNanchor_a_a"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_a_a" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>.
Some Authors led by the Title of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Book of his Epidemics, <i>viz.</i> &#922;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#923;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#974;&#948;&#951;&#962; or the Pestilential Constitution,
have imagin&#39;d the Diseases here
spoken of, to be the same with that
terrible Plague describ&#39;d by <i>Thucydides</i>,
which taking its Rise in <i>Æthiopia</i>, and
passing thence thro&#39; <i>Lybia</i> and <i>Ægypt</i>,
miserably harass&#39;d all <i>Persia</i>, <i>Ph&oelig;nicia</i>,
<i>Judea</i>, <i>Greece</i>, and <i>C&oelig;le Syria</i>, and was
one of the most dreadful Calamities of
this kind that ever appeared in the World.
But whosoever will give himself the
Trouble to compare the Symptoms of
the Fevers here described by <i>Hippocrates</i>,
with those related by that accurate Historian<a name="FNanchor_b_b" id="FNanchor_b_b"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_b_b" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>,
who both had it himself, and visited
many others in it, will find that there
is not the least Similitude between them.
The one being highly infectious, and not
the least Appearance of Contagion in the
other: <i>Galen</i> also the best Interpreter
of <i>Hippocrates</i>, in his Comment on this
Book of his Epidemic&#39;s suspects, this Title
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
to be spurious, tho&#39; both he and others
observe much the same Constitution of
the Air to be the Fore-runner of these
Diseases.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>What Places
most
Subject.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Pestilential and Malignant Fevers, are
likewise observ&#39;d to be the most frequent
in those Places where the Climate is hot
and scorching, and especially when Rains
fall in such Seasons of the Year. Thus
in <i>Ægypt</i> and some other Parts of <i>Africa</i>,
if Rains fall during the Months of <i>July</i>
and <i>August</i>, the Plague usually breaks
out the <i>September</i> following<a name="FNanchor_c_c" id="FNanchor_c_c"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_c_c" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">This is still more remarkable in such
Places, as not only are Situated in the
forementioned Climate, but are likewise
deprived of a constant Succession of pure
and clear Air. An Instance of this we
have in <i>Grand Caire</i>, which besides being
subject to the common Disadvantages
of the Country, (as are a Climate
hot and scorching, a Situation low and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
flat, exposed chiefly to the warm Winds,
their Water fetid and stagnating, being
reserv&#39;d in Vaults and Canals, which are
Annually fill&#39;d by the Overflowing of
the River, the Air abounding with putrid
Steams and Exhalations, arising from
the Parts of Animals, Vegetables, and
other Substances brought down and there
deposited by the River), lies close under
the Hill of the Castle, by which all Wind
and Air is intercepted, which causes such
a stifling Heat there, as ingenders many
Diseases.<a name="FNanchor_d_d" id="FNanchor_d_d"></a>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">That these may justly be esteem&#39;d the
Causes of the greater Frequency of these
Diseases in this Place, than others in the
same Climate, appears from their being
so rarely known in those Places, which
tho&#39; equally hot, enjoy an Air free from
Vapours.<a name="FNanchor_e_e" id="FNanchor_e_e"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_e_e" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> Thus in <i>Numidia</i> and some

to be found once in a hundred Years, and
hardly at all in the Land of <i>Negroe</i>.<a name="FNanchor_f_f" id="FNanchor_f_f"></a>

of these Fevers, may be reduced to such
as arise from the Stinks of stagnating

some putrid Exhalations of the Earth,
to the Parts of Animals and Vegetables
putrifying in the open Air, or the taking
of corrupt &amp;amp; unwholsome Nourishment.</p>

<h2>CHAP. III.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Changes wrought in the Animal
Oeconomy from the above-mention&#39;d
Causes, may be reduced to
such as depend either on the Increased
Heat of the Air join&#39;d with its Humidity;
Or to such as are produced from the particular
Qualities of the putrid and Contagious
Particles floating in it; Or to the
united and complicated Effects of all
together.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Effects of
a hot and
moist Air.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Alterations produced in the Body
from a greater Heat continually surrounding
it, provided it be not Excessive,
are a Rarefaction of the Juices,
and Relaxation of the <i>Fibres</i> on the Surface
of the Body, and greater Derivation
of the Fluids that way. Whence
proceeds a large Evacuation of the perspirable
Matter. This being continued
in a greater Proportion than in a Natural
State, will gradually deprive the Blood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
of its Aqueous and Spirituous Parts, and
leave the remaining serous Part more
stock&#39;d with acrid and pungent Salts,
and the Gross, Terrestrious, Oleaginous,
and Viscous Particles more firmly united
by their nearer Approach, and stronger
Cohesion to each other. This greater
Heat or Quantity of Fiery Particles, continually
surrounding the Body, will necessarily
insinuate it self into, and unite with
the Saline, Sulphureous, and other Particles,
in the same manner as we see it does
with other Substances, both Solid and
Liquid<a name="FNanchor_l_l" id="FNanchor_l_l"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_l_l" class="fnanchor">[l]</a>; And likewise by increasing
the Velocity of the Circulation and Attrition
of the Particles against each other,
render them on these Accounts also more
Volatile, Pungent and Stimulating, and
consequently the Blood will consist of
Particles more gross and inspissated or
coagulated, and likewise of those of a
more acrid and pungent Disposition than
in a natural State.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
The Blood being in this depraved
Condition, the rest of the Animal Juices
must degenerate in Proportion thereto,
and the Nervous Fluid, as it consists of
the most volatil and subtil Parts, be extreamly
acrid and pungent, as well as
unequal in its Texture and Fluidity, from
the more viscous Parts contain&#39;d in it.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Putrid Fevers
how
produced.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This then being the State of the Blood
and other juices of the Body, it is easy
to perceive how from very Slight, and
otherwise trivial Occasions, a Fever of
a very Malignant Nature may be produced.
Thus the perspirable Matter from
a slight Cold taken being retained, or
the Vessels any otherwise filled by Irregularities
in Diet, or others of the Non-naturals,
the Weight of the moving
Fluid will be increased, and the Circulation
be more languid and slow. Whence
the intestine Motion of the Particles of
the Blood being diminished, the viscous
Parts will cohere more strongly and in
greater Quantities than before, and obstruct
the Capillary Arteries, especially in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
the Extremities, and a Coldness, Stretching,
Yawning, Torpor, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i> necessarily
succeed, the constant Attendants of a beginning
Fever; All which will bear a
Proportion to the Quantity retain&#39;d, and
the Viscosity of the moving Fluid.</p>

<p class="indent">These Disorders will necessarily be increased
on account of the Air&#39;s Spring
being weakned by its Heat, the Vessels
of the Lungs being less inflated, and the
Globules of the Blood less broken and
divided, and the more especially in a
humid Air, Heat and Moisture necessarily
relaxing the Tone of the Fibres and
Vessels, and rendring them less Springy
and Elastic. Hence then the Quantity
of Spirits being diminish&#39;d, and their
Motion more slow, the Contraction of
the Heart and other Muscles will be more
weak and languid, and being stimulated
by the Acrimony of the Circulating Liquors,
must contract more frequently
than in a Natural State; The Consequence
of which is Weakness, Faintness,
Thirst, and Dejection of Spirits.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
These and the preceeding Symptoms
will necessarily continue, &#39;til such time
as the gross and viscous Matter, being
shook and loosen&#39;d by the Action of the
Capillary Vessels, is washed away into
the Veins by the force of the Circulating
Fluids, and there continues its Course
with the rest, &#39;til it be either attenuated
and secreted, or lodged again in the Capillaries
to excite new Disorders.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Malignant
Fevers.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Now if to this evil Disposition of the
Air be added a number of pungent stimulating
Particles, whether bred in the
Body or floating in the Air, and thereby
communicated to the Blood, which are
apt to coagulate the Animal Juices, so
as to form <i>Moleculæ</i> of such Shapes
and Sizes as more firmly obstruct the
Capillary Vessels, and at the same time
stimulate and corrode the nervous Parts;
It will necessarily happen, that the preceeding
Symptoms must be highly exasperated,
and a Fever of a much worse
Nature produc&#39;d.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
Hence then must follow a violent
Hurry and Colluctation of the Fluids,
the Viscid and coagulated Parts of the
Blood in some Parts obstructing the
Circulation of the Juices, and the Acrid,
Volatil, and Fiery Parts, rarefying and
dissolving others of the more Liquid,
to the greatest degree of Pungency and
Volatility imaginable.</p>

<p class="indent">Hence it is easy to perceive how the
Motion of the Blood must necessarily be
in some Parts more languid, by the Cohesion
of the more Viscous parts, in others
quicker, join&#39;d with a pungent and
stimulating heat, from the increased Velocity
and Acrimony of the moving Fluid,
and the various Actions of the Particles
upon each other, and their Impulses on
the containing Vessels; As also how
these are capable of almost infinite Variations,
in Proportion to the different
Quantities and Qualities of the constituent
Particles. Hence then appears the
Reason of that wandering and uncertain
Heat and Coldness, in different Parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
the Body at the same time. Hence appears
the Reason of that great Inquietude
and Anxiety, of those uncertain
and partial Sweats, Watchings, Tremors,
stretching Pains of the head, and the like,
as will be more fully shown hereafter.</p>

<p class="indent">But before I proceed to explain the
Nature of a Fever truly Pestilential, it
will be necessary to observe, that notwithstanding
the foremention&#39;d putrid
Disposition be generally a Prelude to a
Pestilential Constitution of the Air, yet
it has never that I know of been observ&#39;d,
that these Causes alone at their
first Onset, produced a real Plague or
Pestilential Contagion, without the Concurrence
of some preceeding Infection,
either brought from abroad, or gradually
augmented from the increased Putrifaction
of the Air, and Poisonous Steams
of Morbid Bodies.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus the putrid Air of Camps in hot
Countries is frequently found to produce
Pestilential Fevers, but this never
happens at their first Onset; The Diseases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
first appearing being Fluxes, Putrid,
and afterwards Malignant Fevers;
which being exasperated and propagated
by the Virulent Effluvia of Diseased
Bodies, and the increased Putrifaction
of the Air, grow up gradually to those
of a Pestilential, and exceedingly infectious
Disposition.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Of Putrifaction
&amp;amp;
Fermentation.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Now Putrifaction being only a kind
of Fermentation, wherein the Particles
of a putrifying Body are put into an intestine
Motion, and by their Action and
Attrition broken and divided, and since
all fermenting Substances do emit vast
Quantities of small separable Parts, it
will necessarily follow, that the most
subtil and active Particles of the Purifying
Body will be elevated into the
Air, and float in it.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Effluvia
from putrified
Bodies
what.</i></p>

<p class="indent">These Effluvia consist of the finest and
most volatil saline and oleaginous Particles,
highly attenuated and set at Liberty
from the gross Oil and Terrestrious
Part, as appears from the Distillation
of such Substances, all which afford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
great Quantities of a pungent and volatil
Salt. It is likewise observable, that
the subtil Oleaginous Particles being specifically
lighter, as well as more easily
attenuated and divided than those of a
Saline Nature, will be thrown off in
greater Proportion in the beginning of
the Fermentation or Putrifaction than
the heavier Salts will be, which must
either be more attenuated and volatilised,
or require a greater force to raise
them into, and sustain them in the Air
than the former, and consequently the
greatest Emission of these saline Particles
will be after the Fermentation has been
for some time continued; As we find it
happens in all fermenting Liquors, as
Wine, Beer, Cyder, and the like. All
which emit, during the Fermentation,
greater Quantities of Particles of an active
attenuated Oil or Spirit for some time,
than of a Saline Nature, which requiring
a longer time in order to attenuate them,
are not raised till the former are in a
manner quite exhaled, as appears from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
collecting the Steams of fermenting Liquors,
and of those which are turn&#39;d
sower by Distillation, and consequently
the Exhalations arising from putrifying
Bodies will after some time consist mostly
of Saline Particles highly attenuated and
volatilised, and those not wrapt up and
sheathed in the Oily ones, and thereby
render&#39;d innocuous, and often useful to
the Body, but naked and exceedingly
acrid and poignant.</p>

<p class="indent">How unfit an Air stock&#39;d with these
kind of Particles is for Respiration, appears
from several of Mr. <i>Boyl</i>&#39;s Experiments
on Animals, shut up with putrified
Air in the Receiver, most of which
with incredible Inquietude die sooner
than in <i>Vacuo</i>, as also from the pernicious
Effects of the Steams of Vaults, Mines, the
<i>Grotto de Cane</i>, and such like. But besides
this Inaptitude of such Air to expand
the Pulmonary Vessels, these minute and
pungent Particles may be considered as so
many <i>Stimuli</i> or Lancets, acting upon
and penetrating the Coats of the Stomach,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
Lungs, and other Vessels. On
which Account they are not only capable
of creating great Disordes, as Inflamation,
Pain, Sickness, Anxiety, Vomiting,
<i>&amp;amp;c.</i> in the Stomach and Nervous
Parts; But likewise being carried immediately
into the Blood, will there stimulate
the ultimate Vessels, ferment, dissolve,
or coagulate the circulating Juices
according to the particular Qualities and
Quantity of the Contagious Particles.
Nor is it unlikely, that from the various
Action of the Particles upon each other,
and their different Combinations in a
stagnating Air, Particles may be formed
of Qualities vastly differing from, and in
their Force almost infinitely exceeding
those of their Primogenial Salts and first
Principles, as in Sublimate, some Preparations
of Antimony, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i> Instances of
which those versed in Chymistry are no
Strangers to.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Infectious
Particles
how produced.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Now supposing the Blood Saturated
with these kind of Particles, and a Malignant
Fever produced by their means,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
we all know that the Blood in this State
throws off vast Quantities of subtil and
active Particles thro&#39; the Perspirable, Salival,
and other Excretory Ducts of the
Body, which not only must load the
adjoining Air with great Quantities of
them, and render it capable of producing
more dismal Effects than the preceeding,
but also the Particles thus thrown off
must be endued with a more acrid and
pungent Disposition than the former, inasmuch
as they are more subtily divided and
attenuated by the Force of the Fever,
than those in the preceeding Disposition
of the Air, where so powerful an Agent
was wanting, And consequently produce
a Fever of a most infectious and deleterious
Nature; And especially when the
Infection is taken toward the latter end
of the Disease, at which time the Saline
Particles will be more exalted and volatilised,
as well as thrown off in greater
Quantities, and thereby made more capable
of producing an infectious Contagion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
For the Blood in these Circumstances
may not unaptly be compared, as was
before hinted, to a fermenting Liquor,
whose Parts being constantly in Motion,
are continually throwing off great Quantities
of subtil and active Spirits, capable
of exciting the same Fermentation, and
producing the same Qualities in those of
the like Species, as appears from our
manner of fermenting Ale, Beer, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i>
with Yeast, which is a Spirituous Ferment,
and also from the Sower Ferments
used in making Vinegar, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Analogous to this we may observe,
that the Blood in different Diseases, as
well as different Animals, throws off
great Quantities of active Particles,
which when mixed with the Blood of a
Healthful Person, are capable of exciting
the same Fermentation and Disorder
in the Animal Juices, with those
of the Morbid Animal from which they
exhale, as we find in the <i>Small-Pox</i>,
<i>Measles</i>, <i>Saliva</i> of a <i>Mad-dog</i>, and the
like.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
This then being the Disposition of
the Blood and other Juices, in those
Fevers which we call Pestilential, it is
evident, that whatever the particular
Substance of the Contagious Particles
may be, they must be endued with such
Qualities as will Coagulate the Animal
Juices, Stimulate the <i>Fibres</i> to frequent
Vibrations, cause Obstructions in the Capillary
Vessels, and render the Blood and
other Juices of the Body exceedingly Acrid
and Pungent, as appears from hence
and the foregoing Propositions; The
Symptoms and Consequences (<i>cæteris
paribus</i>) being the same, whether the
Disease has gradually grown up to this
Height, or took its Rise only from Contagious
Particles brought from abroad.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>How propagated.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This is the Method by which I suppose
these Contagious and Pestilential
Particles to be first generated and produced,
in those places which are most
subject to them, and thence propagated
first into the Neighbourhood, and
afterwards to greater Distances by way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
of Intercourse and Commerce. The Pestilential
<i>Effluvia</i> being pack&#39;d up and conveyed
in Goods of a soft and loose Texture,
as Silk, Wool, Cotton, and the like;
And so much the more easily, as the
Air into which these infested Materials
are brought, is predisposed to act in full
Concert with them; as happens in all
Places at some times more than others;
At which time if these infectious Particles
be communicated, they exert their Rage
with the utmost Violence, but frequently
are either dissipated and lost, or produce
Diseases of less fatal Consequence,
in an opposite Disposition of the Air.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Why the
Plague
ceases.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Thus hard Frost, strong cold and Northerly
Winds, are found frequently to
put an End to, or at least bridle the Fury
of Contagious Diseases, and render them
more mild and curable, as was observable
in the Beginning of the last great
Plague in <i>London</i><a name="FNanchor_m_m" id="FNanchor_m_m"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_m_m" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>, and frequently
taken Notice of in other places by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
Writers on this Subject. Consonant to
this we find in <i>Ægypt</i>, that the Rising
of the <i>Nile</i> by giving a fresh Motion to,
and altering the Disposition of their stagnating
and putrid Air, by the mild Vapours
and Nitrous Exhalations<a name="FNanchor_n_n" id="FNanchor_n_n"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_n_n" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> issuing
from it, immediately checks the Raging
of the Plague, and reduces it to a Fever
of a more mild and curable Nature; insomuch
that as <i>Purchas</i> and others inform
us, if there die in <i>Grand Caire</i> 500 Persons
of the Plague the Day before, yet
upon the Increase of the River it ceases
to be Pestilential, and none die of it<a name="FNanchor_o_o" id="FNanchor_o_o"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_o_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>.
And indeed it can hardly be imagin&#39;d,
how the Plague when it has once got
establish&#39;d in any Place, shou&#39;d cease but
with the Destruction of all or most of the
Inhabitants, was it not checked by some
Alteration in the Disposition of the Air,
and gradually reduced to a Fever of a
more mild and curable Disposition.</p>

<h2>CHAP. IV.</h2>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Of a Pestilence
by
Contagion.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Contagious Particles whether
they be generated in the Air, or
produced by the <i>Effluvia</i> of Morbid Bodies,
being sustain&#39;d in it, are thereby
applied to the Surface of our Bodies,
with a Force equal to the Pressure of the
Incumbent Atmosphere. This Pressure
upon the External Superficies of a human
Body of a middle Size, has been demonstrated
to be equal to 39900 Pounds
Troy-weight, and consequently supposing
the Body in every Part encompassed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
with these Particles, the whole Force
with which all these Particles are on this
Account propell&#39;d into the Body, will amount
to the aforesaid Sum. But every single
Particle is only applied with the Force
of a Column of Air of the Height of the
Atmosphere, and whose Base is equal to
the Surface of that Side of the intruding
Particle, opposite to the cutting Angle.
Now the Contagious Particles from their
extream Smallness and pungent Angles,
may not only be consider&#39;d as Bodies applied
to us with the preceeding Force,
but likewise as so many small Knives or
Lancets, acting upon and penetrating the
Coats of the Lungs and Surface of our
Bodies, with a Force proportional to the
Smallness of their cutting Angles. This
appears not only from several Propositions
in Mechanics, but even to our
Senses, by the strong Contraction of a
Cord or Fiddle-string in moist Weather.
The Particles of Water from their exceeding
Smallness, being protruded into
the Cord, with a Force capable of Raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
the greatest Weights. Now if to
these be likewise added the strong attractive
force of these small Volatil Particles,
occasioned from their Exiguity,
it will be no difficult matter to conceive,
that they are capable of penetrating the
Vessels of our Bodies. Thus the Attractive
Force of the Magnet is greater
in Proportion to its Bulk, in Small ones,
than in those of a larger Size, from the
greater Proximity of all its Particles to
each other. And &#39;tis on this Account
that Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i> computes the Attractive
Force of the Particles of Light,
to be to that of other Bodies, as
1000000000000000 to 1, in Proportion
to the Quantity of Matter contained in

<p class="indent">This I think is sufficient to shew, that
these Acrid and Pungent Particles are
able to penetrate the Surface of our Bodies,
and get into the Blood that way;
And indeed Experience it self confirms
it in all other Pungent and Acrid Substances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
as <i>Garlic</i>, <i>Cantharides</i>, <i>Arsenic</i>,

<p class="sidenote"><i>The Pressure

<p class="indent">But tho&#39; the whole Superficies of our
Bodies are Penetrable by these Poisonous
Particles, yet the principal Mischief is
communicated to the Blood in its Passage
thro&#39; the Lungs. For considering the
prodigious Number of the Pulmonary
Vesicles, into all which the Air enters
in Respiration, and likewise the vast
Increase of their Surfaces on that Account,
and also the greater Force by
which these Particles are applied to the
Internal Surfaces of the Vesicles in Expiration,
in Proportion to that whereby
they are applied to other Parts of the
Body of equal Superficies; it will evidently
appear, that the Contagion is
chiefly communicated by these Vessels to
the Blood. For it appears by the Barometer,
that every Inch Square upon the
Surface of our Bodies is pressed upon by
a Weight nearly equal to 1800 Drams,
when the Mercury stands highest in the
Barometer. Now supposing with Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
<i>Kiel</i><a name="FNanchor_q_q" id="FNanchor_q_q"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_q_q" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> that both the Lobes of our
Lungs contain 226 solid Inches, of
which only 1/3 or 75 Inches are Vesicles.
Supposing also the Diameter of a Vesicle
to be 1/50 Part of an Inch, the Surface of
the Vesicle will be .001256 and the Solidity
.0000043, by which if we divide
75 the Space fill&#39;d by the Vesicles, the
Quotient, <i>viz.</i> 17441860 X .001256
the Surface of a Vesicle, gives the Sum
of the Surfaces of all the Vesicles, =
21906.976 square Inches. Which Sum
being multiplied by 1800, the Number
of Drams which every square Inch of the
Surface of our Bodies sustains, gives the
Weight which the whole Internal Surface
of the Lungs sustains by the sole
Pressure of the Atmosphere, when the
Mercury stands highest in the Barometer,
equal to 39442556.800 Drams, equal
to 410859.966 + 64/96 lib. <i>Troy</i> weight, as
appears from the known Laws of <i>Hydrostaticks</i><a name="FNanchor_r_r" id="FNanchor_r_r"></a>

<p class="indent">Now if to this be added the increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
Pressure of the Air, against the internal
Surfaces of the Vesicles in Expiration,
the Force will be found to be still greater.
For supposing the Diameter of the <i>Larynx</i>
to be equal to O.5 of an Inch; Supposing
also the Pressure of the <i>Larynx</i>
in an ordinary Expiration, by which the
Force of the expired Air exceeds the
Pressure of the Atmosphere, to be two
Ounces, as has been found by Experiment<a name="FNanchor_s_s" id="FNanchor_s_s"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_s_s" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>,
the Pressure of the Air in an
ordinary Expiration upon the Internal
Surface of the Vesicles of the Lungs,
will on this Account only be equal to
1844736 Drams, or 19216 lib. <i>Troy</i>
weight, which added to the Pressure on
the Vesicles by the Weight of the Atmosphere,
amounts to 39444401.536
Drams, or 410879.182 + 64/96 Pounds <i>Troy</i>
weight. But the Pressure of the Air on
all the rest of the Surface of our Bodies
amounts but to 39900 lib. <i>Troy</i>, which
is to the Pressure upon the Internal Surface
of the Lungs, as 1 to 10.297 + 28882/39900,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
and consequently many more of the Contagious
Particles will be communicated
this way, than thro&#39; the whole Surface
of the rest of the Body. The Weights
aforemention&#39;d are indeed prodigious,
but that is caused by the great Increase
of Surface by the Number of the Vesicles:
For it is still to be consider&#39;d,
that the Pressure upon each square Inch
of the Surface of these Vesicles, amounts
to no more than the Pressure on every
Inch Square on the Surface of our Bodies,
except that Increase which is made by
the Force of Expiration, otherwise these
Vesicles cou&#39;d in no wise withstand so
prodigious a Pressure. This Quantity <i>viz.</i>
75 Cubic Inches or thereabouts seems to
be emitted from the Lungs in an ordinary
Expiration, for I have found by Experiment,
that the Lungs in a large Expiration
will emit above 160 Cubic Inches
of Air. Having my self fill&#39;d an exhausted
Receiver of that Size with Air at
one Expiration, of the same Density
with that of the Atmosphere.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
Now if we likewise consider the exceeding
Smallness of the Pulmonary Vessels,
and also that the whole Quantity of
Blood in the Body must necessarily pass
this Organ, in order to its being attenuated
and made fit for Circulation; It
will necessarily follow, that the Alterations
made in the Texture of the Blood
by the Poisonous <i>Effluvia</i>, are communicated
to it chiefly thro&#39; this Organ.
Besides, the Poisonous Particles do not
only Enter into the Blood in greater
Quantities in this Bowel, but when carried
by these Passages, are capable of
doing much more Mischief, than if entring
in at any other Part of the Body,
in Regard that they are more intimately
mixt with it in its Comminution. I have
insisted the more largely on this Argument,
because I find that most who have
wrote in this Subject, tho&#39; they do suppose
some of the Contagious Particles
may be communicated to the Blood this
way, yet lay the greatest Stress on the
Mixture of these Particles with the <i>Saliva</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
which being swallowed carries them
in common with our Nourishment. &#39;Tis
not Improbable indeed, that many of
these Particles may be this way communicated
to the Blood; but it is as Probable,
that many of them which are by
this way Communicated, lose much of
their Force by their Mixture with the <i>Bile</i>
and other Juices; As we see happens in
the Poison of the <i>Viper</i>, which taken at
the Mouth is not deadly, but when mixed
immediately with the Blood produces
the most violent Symptoms. The same
may be observed from many other Substances,
which may be safely taken into
the Body by the common Passages, as
most Acids, Spirit of Wine, and other
Substances, but when mixed immediately
with the Blood, by Injections into the
Vessels of living Animals, produce Coagulations,
Convulsions, and Death:
The principal Reason which has induced
Physicians to suppose, that the Poisonous
<i>Effluvia</i> are chiefly communicated
by these Passages, are those violent Vomitings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
which frequently accompany it;
But this happens equally in many other
Fevers, where there cannot be the least
Suspicion of Contagion. The only Objection
to what I have here advanced
seems to be, That if the Contagion was
communicated to the Blood chiefly by
the Lungs, the Coagulations wou&#39;d be immediately
form&#39;d there, and this Bowel
totally obstructed. But if we consider,
that the Chief Application of the Air to
the Pulmonary Vesicles is in Expiration,
immediately after which the Blood enters
the <i>Vena Arteriosa</i>, whose Branches
continually grow wider, and give Space
and Time for the Coagulating Particles
to act with their full Force, this Objection
will of it self fall to the Ground.</p>

<p class="indent">The Contagious Particles being by
these Means got into the Blood, do there
by Coagulating and Inspissating the more
gross and tenacious Parts, and highly
Volatilising and Attenuating others of
the most Subtil, reduce the Blood into
the above-mentioned State. Thus we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
see that <i>Milk</i>, which is the Juice of an
Animal, by the Addition of a small
Quantity of an Acid Spirit, changes from
an equal Texture, to one of a more
gross and viscous, as well as more fluid
and watry Substance. The like may be
observed in the White of an Egg and
the Blood of an Animal it self. Analogous
to this is that Experiment of <i>Jo.
Bapt. Alprunus</i>, who examining the Matter
of a Pestilential <i>Bubo</i> by Distillation,
found at first a <i>Phlegm</i>, then a more fat
and oily Matter, and lastly a Salt ascending
into the Neck of the <i>Retort</i>. But
what was the most Remarkable in this
Experiment, was the prodigious Stench
upon opening the Vessels, exceeding as
he expresses it a Thousand Wounds exposed
to the Summer&#39;s Heat, and likewise
a Salt so exceedingly Acrid and
Pungent, as to equal, if not exceed
<i>Aq. Regis</i> it self<a name="FNanchor_s1_s1" id="FNanchor_s1_s1"></a>

<p class="indent">I shall not from hence pretend to determine,
that an Acid Salt is the immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
Instrument of these Changes in
the Animal Oeconomy, since the same
may be wrought by Spirit of Wine,
and other Liquids<a name="FNanchor_t_t" id="FNanchor_t_t"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_t_t" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>; and Experience
assures us, that the <i>Effluvia</i>, proceeding
from the putrifying Parts of
Animal Bodies, abound with a Volatil
Alcaline Salt, as appears by Collecting
them by the Bell, or in Distillation, by
which they afford some Phlegm, a most
Fetid Oil, and exceedingly Pungent and
Volatil Salt; But this is sufficiently Evident
from what has been said, that
whatever the determinate Nature of the
particular Particles may be, they do not
only Coagulate the Animal Juices, and
increase the Bulk of the Particles of the
Blood, but render the remaining Part
exceedingly Acrid and Pungent.</p>

<p class="indent">Consonant to this Dr. <i>Hodges</i> has observed

abounded with Saline Particles, and had
the rest Coagulated or Inspissated, as
happens in Scorbutic Constitutions, were
more grievously affected by the Pestilence;
and also that most of those who
Recover&#39;d of the late Plague, were
very much subject to Scorbutic Diseases:
The like I have frequently observed,
where the Small-Pox, Measles, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i> seizes
those of a Scorbutic Habit.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor is the Blood alone affected by its
Mixture with these Saline <i>Spiculæ</i>, but
the rest of the Animal Juices also in Proportion,
and especially the Nervous
Fluid, which consisting of the most fine
Volatil and Subtil Parts, will be render&#39;d
extreamly Acrid and Pungent:
Whence Pain, Sickness, Inflammations,

<p class="indent">The Symptoms accompanying a
Pestilential Fever are Yawning,
Stretching, Coldness, frequently to the
greatest Extremity, Shuddering, suddain
Pains in the Head, Giddiness, Loathing,
Vomiting, a low unequal Pulse, Trembling,
great inward Heat, especially about
the <i>Præcordia</i>, Coldness of the Extremities,
uncertain Sweats, Inquietude,
Stupor, Delirium, Watching, Convulsions,
Carbuncles, Buboes, Livid Vesications,
Purple Spots, <i>Hæmorrhages</i>, which
three last are the certain Forerunners
of Death.</p>

<p class="indent">But here it is to be observed, that all
the preceeding Symptoms do not constantly
happen to every individual Person
who is affected with a Pestilential
Fever, but differ both in Number and
Degree according to the Degree of Infection,
Virulence of the Contagious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Particles, and Constitutions of particular
Persons; Thus the more the Blood is
stock&#39;d with Acrid and Pungent Salts,
and other Parts render&#39;d Glutinous, Coagulated,
or Inspissated, the hotter the
Season of the Year, the more violent the
Symptoms will be, where the Degree of
Infection is equal, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Yawning,
Stretching
Lassitude.</i></p>

<p class="indent">These are the first Signs of the Seisure
of the fatal Enemy, and take their Rise
from the Slowness of the Motion of the
Circulating Fluids. For the Viscosity of
the moving Fluids being increased, and
the <i>Liquidum Nervorum</i> degenerating in
Proportion thereto, the Weight to be
moved will bear a greater Proportion to
the moving Force than in a Natural State,
and consequently the Animal must be
affected with Weariness, as we find it is
in all Cases where the Spirits are exhausted
and weakned, in Proportion to
the Circulating Juices. The other two
are the necessary Consequence of this,
for the Viscosity of the Fluids rendring
them unfit to pass the small Capillary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
Vessels, the Pressure on the <i>Fibres</i> and
Vessels will be increased, excite an uneasy
Sensation, and stimulate them to
more frequent Vibrations, in order to
dislodge the Enemy: Whence follows a
Contraction of the Muscles, and especially
those which serve for Voluntary
Motion, and into which the Spirits are
most frequently determin&#39;d: Hence then
appears the Necessity of such a Method
and Medicines as may dilute and dissolve
the Cohering Fluids, and especially of
such as are taken actually hot, and with
large Quantities of Diluters, the great
Activity of the Fiery Particles contain&#39;d
in them, rendring them much more capable
of penetrating into the smallest
Recesses of the Body, and disjoining
the Coagulated Fluids.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Coldness,
Shuddering.</i></p>

<p class="indent">These likewise depend on the too great
Cohesion of the sanguineous Particles, on
which account the Circulatory as well as
the Motion of the intestine Particles of the
Blood being diminish&#39;d, and many of the
Igneous Particles intangled in the viscous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
Cohesions, a Sensation of Cold must necessarily
ensue, and especially in those
Parts where the Motion of the Blood is
most slow, and its Cohesion increased as
happens in the Extremities. The nervous
Juice being likewise for the same reason
determin&#39;d Irregularly, and in less Quantity
into the Muscles, sometimes one,
sometimes another of them will be
weakly contracted, or a Shuddering
will ensue.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>A Low,
quick, unequal
Pulse.</i></p>

<p class="indent">These arise from the Secretion of a
smaller Quantity of Animal Spirits, and
those too unfit to actuate the Heart and
other Muscles, whence their Contractions
will be more weak, and being stimulated
by the Acrimony of the Juices
more frequent than in a Natural State.
The Derivation likewise of the Nervous
Fluid into the <i>Fibres</i> of the Heart being
irregular, for the Reasons afore-given,
the Motion of the Heart, and consequently
of the Pulse, must be weak,
quick, and unequal.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span></p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Loathing,
Vomiting.</i></p>

<p class="indent">These are occasion&#39;d partly by the
Contagious Particles being drawn in
with the Breath, and in their Passage
tainting the <i>Saliva</i>, which when swallowed
Irritates the Nervous Filaments
of the Stomach, and partly by the Secretion
of a more Pungent and Acrid Matter
by its Glandulous Coat; as appears
from their spontaneous Ceasing as soon
as a Sweat can be procured, and the Discharge
of these Acrid Particles promoted
by the Perspirable Glands<a name="FNanchor_u_u" id="FNanchor_u_u"></a>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Diarrh&oelig;a.</i></p>

<p class="indent">A <i>Diarrh&oelig;a</i> is likewise oftentimes a
Concomitant of these Fevers, and ever
of most dangerous Consequence in the
Beginning of the Disease, inasmuch as
it exhausts the Strength of the Patient,
and prevents the regular Expulsion of
the Perspirable Matter, by which Experience
assures us that these Contagious
Particles are most effectually discharg&#39;d.
These then indicate such Medicines as
cleanse the <i>Primæ Viæ</i> from the Contagious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
Particles, and other Crudities
lodged in them, blunt the Acrimony of
the Saline Particles, and promote the
Regular Expulsion of the Perspirable
Matter.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Coldness
of the Extremities.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This is occasion&#39;d by the weak Contraction
of the Heart, and greater Viscosity
of the Blood in the Extream Parts
of the Body, for the Circulating Fluids
being prest on every Side by the containing
Vessels, the more thin and liquid Part
will pass into such Vessels as arise nearest
the Heart, and leave the rest more Viscous
and unfit for Motion. The Force
of the Heart in the extream Parts being
also much diminish&#39;d, thro&#39; the numerous
Ramifications of the Vessels, the
Motion of the Blood will be more
slow, the Cohesion of the Particles of
the Blood greater, and the Obstructions
in the Capillaries more fixt than in other
Parts of the Body. Now the Heat of the
Body depending in a great Measure on
the Attrition of the Particles against each
other, this being diminish&#39;d in the Extream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
Parts of the Body, the other must
be lessen&#39;d in Proportion.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Great inward
Heat
especially
about the
Præcordia.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This is occasion&#39;d by the greater Intestine
Motion and Colluctation of the
Particles of the Blood, and the Expansive
Particles of Heat being in greater
Proportion in these than other Parts of
the Body, from the more numerous Ramifications
and Obstructions of the Vessels,
and their Proximity to the Heart,
as appears by <i>Prop. 2</i>.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Inquietude
Watching.</i></p>

<p class="indent">These arise from the same Cause as the
Preceeding, the great inward Heat being
a constant <i>Stimulus</i> to the nervous Parts,
and obliging the Sick to seek continual
Change of Place and Posture, in order to
abate this uneasy Sensation. These therefore
indicate the use of such Medicines as
specifically correct the Acrid and Stimulating
Particles, restrain the inordinate
Effervescence of the Circulating Fluids,
and attenuate the Viscous Cohesions, of
which kind are diluting and attenuating
Acids, temperate Cordials and Anodynes,
in such Doses and Proportions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
as are agreeable to the Age, Strength,
and other Circumstances of the Patient.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Delirium.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This arises from the Inordinate Influx
of the <i>Liquidum Nervorum</i>, occasioned
from its Acrimony, Viscosity, and Quantity,
different from those in a healthful
State. Whence the Reflux of the Spirits
to the Brain will be altogether irregular,
and the Representations brought
by them Irrational and Inconsistent.
As this Symptom may arise as well from
the increased as lessen&#39;d Quantity, and
different Texture of the Fluids, and
Springyness of the Solids; so Regard
must be had to the particular State of
the Solids and Fluids in every Individual,
for the abating of this Symptom.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Stupor.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This Symptom necessarily supposes
the Flux of the Spirits thro&#39; the Brain
and Nerves in some Measure intercepted
or diminished, and consequently as the
preceeding may arise from different and
even contrary Causes, but generally in
these Cases shews a greater Degree of
Coagulation in the Juices than the former,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
and consequently of greater Danger
from the more numerous Obstructions
in the Capillary and Nervous Vessels.
Agreeable to which is that Observation
of Dr. <i>Hodges</i>, That they who were attended
with this Symptom rarely recover&#39;d.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Trembling,
Faultering
in the
Speech.</i></p>

<p class="indent">These depend on the same Cause as
the former, <i>viz.</i> On the Diminution or
Obstruction of the <i>Liquidum Nervorum</i>,
whereby the Muscles are involuntarily
and weakly contracted. As these suppose
a more torpid Motion and greater
Viscosity of the Fluids, and less Degree
of Elasticity in the solid Parts, so the
Method taken herein ought to be more
active and stimulating than in any of the
foregoing Symptoms. Whence Epispasticks,
and the most Volatil Attenuating
Medicines are more necessarily required,
and ought to be oftner repeated, than in
preceeding Symptoms.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Pain in
the Head.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This is Occasioned by the Obstruction
of some of the Capillary Vessels
of the Brain by the Coagulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
Part of the Blood, and the wounding
of the Nervous Filaments by the Poisonous
Saline <i>Spiculæ</i>. Whence the Blood
being resisted in its Motion, must press
more strongly against the Sides of the
Vessels, and distend them beyond their
Natural Diameters, and produce a shooting
and throbbing Pain; and if the Obstruction
continue or increase, a Phrensy,
Inflammation, Suppuration, and Gangreen
of the Part affected. Why this
Symptom should be one of the first, as
well as a constant Attendant thro&#39; the
whole Course of the Disease, appears
from <i>Prop. 2</i>.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><i>Carbuncles,
Buboes</i>, &amp;amp;c.</p>

<p class="indent">Hence likewise appears the Reason of
Carbuncles, Boboes, Vesications, and the
like, which take their Rise from the
same Cause, and are different only in

Inflammations, and Mortifications of different
Parts of the Body. Thus the Stomach
and Intestines are commonly highly
Inflamed, and frequently Gangreen&#39;d.
The Lungs, Diaphragm, and several of
the <i>Viscera</i> inflamed, obstructed, and beset
with Carbuncles and Purple Spots. The
Arteries of the <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pia Mater</i> obstructed,
and stuff&#39;d with Grumous Blood,
and often mortified. The Arteries of the
whole Body in general fuller than ordinary,
the Veins more empty. The Vessels
about <i>Præcordia</i> much obstructed, highly
inflamed, and often Gangreen&#39;d. The
membranous Parts of the Body in general
more dry and rigid than in most other
Diseases.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VI.</h2>

<p class="h2"><i>Of the</i> <span class="smcap">Small-Pox</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">From what has been said of the
Nature of Malignant and Pestilential
Diseases it will follow, that the
Contagious Matter producing the Small-Pox
does likewise Coagulate the Blood,
and increase the Bulk of its constituent
Particles, and that in such a Proportion
as are capable of obstructing only the
ultimate and perspirable Vessels, as appears,
in that it principally, if not solely
affects the membranous Parts of the Body,
as well External as Internal. Now
these Parts being formed of such Vessels,
the Pustules could not happen in these
more than other Parts of the Body, were
not their Vessels thus obstructed, and obstructed
they cou&#39;d not be, but from the increased
Bulk of the Sanguineous Particles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
and that in such a Proportion as renders
them capable of penetrating into, but not
passing thro&#39; the Cavities of the ultimate
Vessels, as appears from the preceeding
Propositions, and consequently, the contagious
Matter producing the Small-Pox,
must be indued with this peculiar Property.
And indeed if we allow the different
Degrees of Coagulation in these
Contagious Diseases, and which appear
even to our Senses, it will appear, that
the Principal if not the sole Difference
proceeds only from the greater or less
Bulk and Number of the Coagulated
<i>Moleculæ</i>, and Acrimony of the Coagulating
Matter. Thus we see that in Pestilential
Diseases, where the Degree of
Coagulation and Acrimony of the Juices
are superior to the rest, the Obstructions
happen in the larger Glands, as are those
of the Armpits, Groin, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i> The Circulation
of the Blood being obstructed, or
at lest much retarded in the Capillary
Blood Vessels, as appears from the weak
Pulse, Coldness of the Extremities, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
the like, which constantly accompany
it; And consequently the <i>Moleculæ</i> form&#39;d
by the Coagulation of the Animal Juices
must be larger, than these in the Small
Pox, which proceed to the ultimate
Vessels before the Obstructions are formed.
The <i>Measles</i> are another Confirmation
of this Theory, whose <i>Moleculæ</i>
are still less than the preceeding, as appears
by their Eruption with greater
Flatness, and less Extension of the Obstructed
Vessels. Thus also we see that
in all these Diseases where the Contagious
Matter is more Virulent than ordinary,
or the Constitution of the Year
more productive of these Diseases, or
join&#39;d with a Hot Tense and Scorbutic
Disposition, Diarrhea&#39;s, Dysenteries, Purple
Spots, Hemorrhages, Phrensies, Convulsions,
Inflammations, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i> equally accompany
these as Pestilential Diseases.</p>

<p class="indent">From what has been said in this and
the foregoing Chapters may be deduced
the Reasons of the greater or less Virulency
of the Small-Pox, Measles, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i> in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
some Years more than others; As also
why these Diseases shou&#39;d rage with the
greatest Violence when join&#39;d with, or
immediately preceeding a Pestilential
Constitution of the Air. Hence also appears
the Reason why Pains of the Head,
Stomach, Loins and Back, preceed the
Eruption of the Pustules, these Parts as
nearest the Heart being soonest obstructed,
and the <i>Impetus</i> of the Blood against
the obstructed Canals much greater than
in the rest of the Body. As also why
the Pustules should appear so much
sooner in the Face, Neck and Breast,
than other Parts of the Body, as appears
from <i>Prop. 2</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Hence likewise appears the Reason
why the Fever, Vomiting, Pains, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i>
preceeding the Eruption of the Pustules
should cease or be much diminish&#39;d upon
their Appearance; The <i>Moleculæ</i>, by the
Force of the Circulating Fluids, being
driven into and fixt in the Cutaneous
Glands, and Secretory Vessels, whereby
the Capillary Arteries being freed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
them, a more easy Passage is allowed
to the Circulating Fluids. Hence also
appears the Reason why the Fever gradually
increases with the Augmentation
of the Pustules, the Contiguous Vessels
being compress&#39;d by their Distention,
and the Obstructions in the Secretory
Vessels made more Numerous; whence
the Quantity of the Perspirable Matter
being Diminished, and the Canals
streightned, the Vessels will be more
full, and the Pulse more strong and frequent.
Hence likewise it will follow,
that the more numerous the Obstructions
are, and more pungent the Contagious
Matter, the more Violent the Symptoms
will be, and the Matter of the Pustules
when suppurated become an Acrid and
pungent gleety Substance, or Laudable
<i>Pus</i>. As also why the Time of Suppuration
shou&#39;d vary in Proportion to the
Virulency of the obstructing Matter; and
consequently the Reason of the Difference
between the <i>Distinct</i> and <i>Confluent
Small-Pox</i>. Hence also it will appear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
that Bleeding, in the Beginning of the
Disease, ought only to be Administred
where the <i>Impetus</i> of the Circulating
Fluids is so great, that notwithstanding
the Diminution of the Force
of the Blood by it, the protrusive Force
of the Circulating Mass will exceed the
<i>Impetus</i> made on the Obstructing Matter
by the Vibrations of the <i>Fibres</i>, and
likewise why on its imprudent Use in
the Beginning of the Disease, the Pustules
shou&#39;d disappear, and be driven
back into the sanguineous Vessels. Hence
also may be deduced the Reason of the
Flux by the Salival Glands, the Swelling
of the Face, Hands, and Feet, in the
height of the Disease, the Vessels being
at this time Turgid by the Suppression
of the perspirable Matter; And likewise
the Necessity of such Evacuations, as may
reduce the Pressure of the Fluids upon
them to such a Proportion, as the Tone
of the <i>Fibres</i> may be able to resist; And
why where this is neglected, a <i>Peripneumonia</i>,
Phrensy, Delirium, <i>&amp;amp;c.</i> do frequently
succeed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
<i>Lastly</i>, Hence may be deduced the
Reason why the Small-Pox shou&#39;d rarely
seize those twice, who have had a Competent
Number of them. For the Ultimate
Perspirable Vessels being distended
much beyond their Natural Tone, by
the Bulk of the Obstructing <i>Moleculæ</i>,
the Secretory Vessels must be left wider
than before, and consequently less subject
to be obstructed by Particles of this
Size; Agreeable to this is that Observation
of Dr. <i>Sydenham</i> and others, That
in those Constitutions of the Air where
the Small-Pox were very <i>Epidemic</i>,
many (especially such as attended the
Sick) who before had been affected with
this Disease, were seized with a Fever
in all Respects the same with that attending
the Small-Pox, except only the
Eruption of the Pustules, and the Symptoms
which necessarily attend on them.</p>

<p class="indent">The Pressure of the Atmosphere
on the internal Surface of the
Lungs, as computed in the foregoing
Pages, so much exceeding that made
by the ingenious Dr. <i>Kiel</i>, in the last
Edition of his Book of Animal Secretion,
it may not be amiss for the farther
Illustration of it, to show that the
Weight computed by that Learned Author
is not really the whole Pressure of
the Atmosphere, but the Force of the
Lungs in Expiration, by which they exceed
the Pressure of the Air upon them.
For let the Tube A B
be inserted into the
Vessel C D E F of any
given Dimension, and
both the Tube and
Vessel fill&#39;d with Water
or any other Fluid, it
is evident from the
Writers in Hydrostatics,
that the Vessel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
C D E F will be pressed upon on every
Part of its Internal Surface equal to the
Basis of the Tube, by the Weight of a
Column of the contained Fluid of the
same Height with the Fluid, and whose
Base is equal to that of the Tube, and
consequently every Inch Square on the
Internal Surface of the Lungs will be
pressed upon by a Column of Air, whose
Height is equal to that of the Atmosphere,
and base one Inch Square, which
will amount to the aforesaid Sum. <i>Vide
Pag.</i> 34 &amp; 35.
Now if we
suppose the
Tube X inserted
into
the Neck of
the Bladder Y
and the Air
forced into
the Bladder
in Expiration, to an equal Density with
that of the incumbent Atmosphere, it is
evident that the Air will not go out by
the Tube without some external Force,
being in <i>Æquilibrio</i> with the Atmosphere,
and consequently the Force by
which it is expressed thro&#39; the Tube,
must be that by which it exceeds the
Pressure of the Atmosphere, upon the
Orifice of the Tube.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
If any one think that I have allowed
too large a Quantity of Air to be taken
into the Lungs in an Ordinary Inspiration,
That is sufficiently recompensed
by supposing the Diameter of the
<i>Larynx</i> equal to O.5 and its Orifice O.19
which is more than it can be, for the
Diameter does not exceed O.4, and consequently
its Orifice will be but O.12. Now
it being demonstrated by the Writers in
Hydrostatics, that Weights forcing equal
Quantities of the same Fluid out
of the same Orifice, are to each other
as the Squares of the Times in which the
Fluid is forced out, and that in equal
Times and Quantities of the same Fluid
forced thro&#39; unequal Orifices, the weights
are Reciprocally as the Orifices; The
Powers forcing an equal Quantity of Air
thro&#39; the Orifices O.19 and O.12 must be
to each other in a Reciprocal Proportion,
compounded of the Squares of the Times
and Orifices of the Tubes; Which will
be found sufficient to answer any Objection
of this kind, by any who will
give himself the Trouble to compute it.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
